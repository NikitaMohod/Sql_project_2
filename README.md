## 1. Executive Summary
This report presents an analysis of the IMDB movie database, focusing on key trends in movie production, genre popularity, ratings, and the performance of actors and directors. The analysis aims to provide insights into movie release patterns, the impact of genre on duration, the top-performing production houses, and leading talent based on audience ratings.

## 2. Data Overview and Quality Check
The analysis utilized six tables: director_mapping, genre, movie, names, ratings, and role_mapping.
Null Value Check (Movie Table): A comprehensive check for null values in the movie table revealed the following:
•	title_nulls: 0
•	year_nulls: 0
•	duration_nulls: 0
•	date_published_nulls: 0
•	country_nulls: Significant number of nulls observed, indicating missing country information for some movies.
•	worldwide_gross_income_nulls: Significant number of nulls observed, indicating missing income data for many entries.
•	languages_nulls: Significant number of nulls observed.
•	production_company_nulls: Significant number of nulls observed.
Implication: While core movie details like title, year, duration, and publication date are complete, missing data in country, worldwide_gross_income, languages, and production_company might affect analyses requiring these fields, potentially leading to incomplete insights if not handled (e.g., by excluding nulls or assuming a default).
